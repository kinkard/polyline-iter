# About

This crate is my opinionated version of the [georust/polyline](https://github.com/georust/polyline) crate where I tried to make it more ergonomic and performant.

Basically, the decoding algorithm is taken from here - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm
